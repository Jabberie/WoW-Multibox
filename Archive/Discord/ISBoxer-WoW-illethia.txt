[00:34] illethia: @here generic question - how many multiboxers have been banned wrongfully for "botting" and feel hurt by blizzard and shut out and victimized?
[00:43] Jabberie: I would say that nearly no multiboxer has been banned that didn't look like a bot to them.
[00:43] Jabberie: Ask goldie as a recent example.
[00:44] Jabberie: Once you understand what they see compared to what you're doing and make you case around that, then you get places.
[01:01] illethia: I understand this @Jabberie , I am going to reddit and the forums on behalf of somebody who was incorrectly banned. The supervisor keeps saying "you could be botting, so we're not doing anything"
[01:01] illethia: I was going to ask here for support from everybody, because my voice is small
[01:02] Jabberie: Championing someone will not change the outcome. Only that person can do anything about it.
[01:03] illethia: When your voice isn't heard, sometimes you need others to help create an echo.
[01:03] illethia: Not everybody is good with words or has a platform to spread something, sometimes we need to help as a community
[01:03] Jabberie: The sentiment is nice but the outcome will be the same.
[01:04] Jabberie: If the person has been reviewed by the hacks team and the answer is still no, the answer is not changing.
[01:04] illethia: That's not true
[01:04] illethia: Actually 100% untrue, and i can speak from experience
[01:05] Jabberie: Read carefully what I just said please. It's very specific.
[01:06] illethia: Read carefully to what I said, I've personally witnessed a change in results because the hacks team said no but a supervisor said something different.
[01:06] Jabberie: Was it your own account?
[01:07] illethia: I wrote the email they sent that resulted in the unban after their original appeal and no from the hacks team, they reopened an appeal with my email and it overturned
[01:07] illethia: Stop fighting me
[01:07] Jabberie: Was it your own account?
[01:07] illethia: Either lend your support as part of the community, or don't that's all i'm asking
[01:07] illethia: If they post and i write, it makes no difference, correct?
[01:07] Obsurd: LOL.  You're the one asking for help, then arguing with the response you get because you don't like it.
[01:09] illethia: @Obsurd I'm asking for support, and somebody comes in saying "it won't work, don't bother" - if i ask people to help support somebody it shouldn't matter what your opinion is, if you don't want to support then don't it's simple.
[01:09] illethia: You don't have to say "it won't make a difference"
[01:09] illethia: That's my point
[01:09] Jabberie: What you are saying is not going to work. The person that is banned asking to have a proper review from the proper team will.
[01:10] Jabberie: And if that has already happened and the answer was still no. Then they are royally screwed.
[01:10] illethia: You can always go higher in a company, and community support is a HUGE backup
[01:11] Jabberie: I give up. Good luck.
[01:11] illethia: Thanks
[01:12] Obsurd: I'm not going to sit here and argue with you.  You've been given factual information.  You choose to argue with it.

Not even going to mention the whole "help my friend that won't ask for help him/herself" plea.  More than likely because he/she knows that he/she did something wrong on top of legitimately multi-boxing.
[01:13] illethia: @Obsurd Or they are broken down and don't know how to voice something correctly - I can write something and she can post it, then the community if they agree can upvote / support / do whatever correct? THAT was my original fact.
[01:13] illethia: As to the first part of that, again I've personally witnessed a reversal from hacks team -> Higher up, am i just dumb for taking my PERSONAL witnessing and interaction into this?
[01:14] Jabberie: Without it being your own account it's hearsay.
[01:14] illethia: So if you got hit with a rock, but i threw it, because i didn't get hit with a rock but saw it it's hearsay?
[01:14] illethia: but i saw it**
[01:14] illethia: not threw it
[01:14] Obsurd: Jibber jabber,  you can't argue with blocked messages.  Should try it.  :stuck_out_tongue:
[01:15] Jabberie: Fair enough Obs
[01:19] Hellortha: I don't use ISBoxer but have had a ban from multiboxing which I appealed to the point I got the automated message saying they will not respond to the issue anymore, I managed to still get it overturned a few days after by speaking to the right person and figuring out how to properly go about the situation.(edited)
[01:20] Jabberie: It's very easily done.
[01:20] Jabberie: Assuming your innocent and make the proper request.
[01:21] Obsurd: And it's oh, YOUR account you're trying to appeal.  And not someone else's and/or having someone else try to do it on your behalf.
[01:21] Hellortha: If you have experience in it sure, but the reason I had so many appeals was because I didn't know how to go about a proper request, I had to include my script, gm checks, macros, addons etc
[01:21] Jabberie: Goldie is a great example of this.
[01:21] Fredriko_9004: Hello
[01:22] Jabberie: He went through this only a couple of weeks ago.
[01:22] Goldie: Yes, i did
[01:22] Hellortha: Obsurd I can understand that thinking, but if your GF was banned, you'd help her no? it's not always the first thing we assume :stuck_out_tongue:
[01:23] illethia: Not GF officially ^^  But yeah :p
[01:37] Obsurd: Can't wait to have actual bag space in a couple hours
[01:40] Jabberie: haha, dmf?
[01:40] Obsurd: Yeah  lol
[01:40] Jabberie: I might actually do it this time around.
[01:40] Jabberie: You holding all your BoP stuff as well?
[01:40] Obsurd: Mailbox is over flowing on 1 character with BOA ones.  then a lot of the others have sb ones filling up bags/bank
[01:41] Obsurd: Yeah, so that I get more boa to bombard my mailbox next one.  LOL
[01:41] Jabberie: 10% is a lot I guess if you want to min/max
[01:42] Obsurd: I'll probably stop focusing so much on it once I get the other para mounts and crap I'm missing, but still...going to be a nice chunk of gold/OR as well for just waiting to open something for a month
[01:53] Skittlezz420: @Jabberie @Obsurd He is asking for me so nothing he is saying is hearsay... Everyone in the gold farming community know i bust my ass and earn my gold.. I HATE botters and would never do it myself but blizz isnt hearing me and wont unban me.. He is only trying to help no need to be rude to him
[01:54] Jabberie: his hearsay has nothing to do with you.
[01:55] Jabberie: Please read the entire conversation if you want to have a go.
[01:56] Hellortha: Jabberie, he was talking about Skittlez
[01:56] Hellortha: she is the person banned who he is helping with (just clearing confusion if any)(edited)
[01:56] Jabberie: i know, but has she had her account already overturned?
[01:57] illethia: Once, 5 months ago, this is a new ban. The original unabn was from an email I WROTE for her. That was my point
[01:57] Skittlezz420: Well you were saying it was hearsay that i was banned before and had it overturned well im here to tell you it happened to me 5 months ago..
[01:57] Jabberie: You were never mentioned before.
[01:58] Jabberie: He is failing at giving any information to be honest(edited)
[01:58] illethia: I shouldn't have to mention specific names.
[01:58] Skittlezz420: So just cause blizz says your banned doesnt mean you cant fight it
[01:58] Skittlezz420: And keep fighting it
[01:58] Jabberie: I never said you can't fight it
[01:58] Skittlezz420: Where is the support?
[01:58] Jabberie: Did i?
[01:58] Skittlezz420: Why so damn rude?
[01:58] Obsurd: OMG.  Learn how to read?  No one stated that
[01:58] Jabberie: Why are you being so rude?
[01:59] Skittlezz420: You went in on @illethia for no reason after him asking for support? When did you turn into the grinch?
[01:59] Jabberie: What?
[01:59] illethia: Jabberie - Today at 8:03 PM
The sentiment is nice but the outcome will be the same.
If the person has been reviewed by the hacks team and the answer is still no, the answer is not changing.
[01:59] illethia: The answer is not changing basically states "don't bother trying"
[01:59] Jabberie: Are you the person banned?
[01:59] Jabberie: No, you're not.
[01:59] Skittlezz420: Do you read?
[01:59] Skittlezz420: I just said yes
[02:00] illethia: I asked for support behind a post for her, maybe i should have said involving, for that maybe i'm sorry.
[02:00] Jabberie: I'm just going to leave now as obviously English is being a little hard for folk tonight.
[02:00] Hellortha: o.O
[02:00] dakota6116: hello?!
[02:00] Skittlezz420: Wow Jab.. Thanks for the support
[02:00] Skittlezz420: Good to know there is helping people out there still
[02:02] Jabberie: Go back and read how your BF came in here and tried to rally the support.
[02:03] illethia: I said not officially BF
[02:03] illethia: You obviously can't read
[02:03] PaperGoose: no habla ingles. espanol por favor?
[02:03] Skittlezz420: I thank him for trying to get people behind me and support me just like any other multiboxer would
[02:03] Skittlezz420: So thank you @illethia !!
[02:03] Obsurd: Don't know how to word it in such a way that it can actually be comprehended.  Already wasted enough time with this than really should have.

You're right.  Everyone else is wrong.  Keep fighting the fight!
[02:04] Skittlezz420: If you wasted enough time then get out of the convo you arent helping with
[02:04] Skittlezz420: How about that
[02:04] Skittlezz420: @Hellortha Discord boo
[02:05] Hellortha: Hey Skittlez :smiley:
[02:05] Skittlezz420: Hop in my discord
[02:05] Skittlezz420: Poorfavor
