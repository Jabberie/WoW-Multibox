The ideal set up is to be making 5 new accounts. This way you can link them in a loop so that you get grantable levels on all your characters.

A change to how RAF works, means you are able to create and upgrade all the accounts prior to sending the invitations.   
Or you can do it the old way and use each inviation as you receive it to create the next account. This is a little slower as each new account needs to be upgraded before it can send an invite.

The main issue arises when you accept the receive an invitation and use the link.  
At this point, you need to be careful to make sure you are logged in with the Blizzard Account and that you use the "Already have an account" option.   
You then need to pick the correct WoW License to use the invitation on.  

After they are all linked, be very careful of your realm selection if/when you use your Boost from Legion.  
The game has a nasty habit of placing you on a "New Player" realm and not your RAF realm you are meant to be on.
