This is the beginning of your direct message history with @SKITTLEZZ ! ! !.
[02:13] <3 Hearts <3: What was the reason behind all that? He was simply asking for some support in the multiboxing community and you just shit on him?! What is the point of you being part of this community if your not here to support and help people out? If your having a bad day i understand but there was no need for that
[02:14] Jabberie: What he wanted to do was not going to have any effect at all on what had happened to her account.
[02:14] Jabberie: If that is not something you understand, I'm sorry.
[02:14] <3 Hearts <3: Its my account he is asking about
[02:14] <3 Hearts <3: Ive already said that
[02:14] Jabberie: Look at your user name
[02:15] Jabberie: now look at your ISBoxer username
[02:15] Jabberie: How do I know that?
[02:15] <3 Hearts <3: Because i said that in the discord and so did someone else you just didnt read it
[02:15] Jabberie: 

[02:16] Jabberie: 

[02:16] Jabberie: Who is who?
[02:16] <3 Hearts <3: Its my account i said it and so did hellortha
[02:16] <3 Hearts <3: Im Skittlezz....
[02:16] <3 Hearts <3: Like weve said
[02:17] Jabberie: Then let me rephrase once again
[02:17] Jabberie: Him making a reddit post for you is useless.
[02:17] Jabberie: It's that simple.
[02:17] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: There fixed my name for you
[02:17] Jabberie: Now back to what he actually said.
[02:18] Jabberie: Look at what he came here with.
[02:18] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: I read all the convo
[02:18] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: I know what it says and how you replied
[02:19] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: He was simply asking to see how many boxers have been banned and how they felt about it
[02:19] Jabberie: I gave him an informed opinion on what you should be doing.
[02:19] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: Maybe he started off to strong
[02:19] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: But he wants to post on reddit and have people behind him
[02:20] Jabberie: And that's useless, I already said that to you in here and to a less direct way to him.
[02:20] Jabberie: What do you think it will achieve>
[02:20] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: And if people like me have been banned and feel the same way i do then we would have people to help support the thread
[02:21] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: Im sure there are tons of boxers that have been banned and didnt deserve it
[02:21] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: Do you not?
[02:21] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: But instead of having a lil compassion you just start shitting on him?
[02:21] Jabberie: My very first reply to him answered that.
[02:22] Jabberie: I really wish now that I had started shitting on him tbh.
[02:22] Jabberie: At least then I could make sense of what else happened afterwards.
[02:22] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: But where was the support? Why did you have to react that way when he was jsut trying to be helpful? What kind of support was that? How about hey can you tell me more about what happened and maybe i can give you some info
[02:22] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: But instead your reply back was not gonna work
[02:23] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: Nothing is gonna happen
[02:23] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: So just shit on people who need help if your way of going about things i seee
[02:23] Jabberie: Truthful, sincere and knowledgeable support is that I give.
[02:24] Jabberie: I'm don't faff about the place with half truths and misconceptions
[02:24] Jabberie: He didn't need help. You did.
[02:25] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: You couldnt be anymore wrong? Only your captain save a hoe Obsurd chimed in and agreed with you ever other person weve had read the thread has said you reacted like a dick for no reason
[02:25] Jabberie: The truth hurts
[02:26] Jabberie: And obsurd is a new multiboxer as far as I know. I've had little to no dealings with him beyond converse in the same chat rooms.(edited)
[02:27] Jabberie: if the color of our names is your link there, that's alpha for isboser 2
[02:27] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: Well if you didnt have any support or anything nice to say you should ahve stayed out of it
[02:27] Jabberie: isboxer
[02:28] Jabberie: I did have support, just not the support your bff was expecting.
[02:28] Jabberie: That doesn't mean it wasn't supportive.
[02:28] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: He isnt my bf
[02:28] Jabberie: read again please. that wasn't a typo.
[02:28] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: He already said that guess you didnt read that part
[02:29] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: Either way you didnt have to chim in
[02:29] Jabberie: If you need to attack my obvious sarcasm, I think we're done.
[02:29] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: You chose too and were nasty about it
[02:29] Jabberie: I answered his question.
[02:29] Jabberie: He tagged me back into the conversation.
[02:30] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: Well thats something you do when someone comments on your post silly billy
[02:30] Jabberie: Only if you want to have a conversation with them. Which we did.
[02:31] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: So hes asking a question in a communtiy of multiboxers and you feel the need to comment of course he is gonna tag you back
[02:31] Jabberie: Great then, we're on the same page.
[02:31] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: But you didnt have to comment if you didnt want to know more and possibly support what was going on
[02:32] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: You could have stayed silent like everyone else in the channel
[02:32] SKITTLEZZ ! ! !: But instead you jsut shit on people who are trying to help others lol make complete sense
